        	It seems today that all you see is violence in movies and sex on tv, but where are those good old-fashioned values on which we used to rely? Lucky there's a family guy, lucky there's a man who positively can do all the things that make us laugh and cry - he's our family guy!

        	Wanted to get myself a new cell phone so I could hear myself as a ringtone. Who knew the store would go and check my credit score? Now all they let me have is this dinosaur! Hello hello hello, can anybody hear me? I know I know I know, I should have gone to Free Credit Report dot com! That's where I should have gone, could have got my knowledge on.

        	There were six people who loved to watch television, but they didn't like what they saw. Armed with determination and a strong will to change the course of television, they wrote their own shows, but that wasn't enough, they had to sell them. They went straight to the networks, but the networks were not ready for them. But did that stop them? No. They built their own network and they liked what they saw.

        	You take the good, you take the bad, you take them both and there you have the facts of life, the facts of life. There's a time you got to go and show you're growin' now you know about the facts of life, the facts of life. When the world never seems to be livin up to your dreams and suddenly you're finding out the facts of life are all about you.

        	What ever happened to predictability? The milkman, the paperboy, evening TV. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go, there's a heart, a hand to hold onto. Everywhere you look, everywhere you go. There's a face of somebody who needs you. Everywhere you look, when you're lost out there and you're all alone, a light is waiting to carry you home, Everywhere you look. Everywhere you look.
